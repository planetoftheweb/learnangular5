# Introduction

This is not a beginner course and I'm assuming that you've got a lot of prior experience before coming to this course.

You should have experience creating websites and specifically have some type of  background with HTML, CSS and a good understanding of [JavaScript](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/javascript-essential-training-3).

I'm also using the bootstrap framework in this course to create HTML code, so a familiarity with that framework would be useful. If you need help with that, check out Bootstrap Essential Training.

You should be comfortable working with build tools like [Npm](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/tooling-with-npm-scripts) as well as [Git and Github](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-git-and-github).

So, if you're comfortable with these requirements...let's get started.
